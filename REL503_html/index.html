        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <h2>Special Skills</h2>
        <p>
            As the residents of the garden, we take pride in its upkeep. We Woods Quad Squirrels ensure the trimming of the bushes and the flourishing of the flowers. Enemies of litter, we let visitors know it is unacceptable. Throw away your trash or risk our wrath! 
            We're also the top food connoisseurs on the UA campus. Peanuts are the love of our life, and, if you're nice, we may share a bite. 
            And finally, throughout the day we frequently take part in song. If you want to enjoy the lively chattering of our people, make sure to visit us! Your ears will surely be blessed.

        <h4>Where to Find Us</h4>
        <p>To the left, you can find a map of our location. The Woods Quad Scupture Garden is located not far from The Student Center. You can usually find one of us galloping aroud the balconies, diving through bushes, or snacking on some peanuts at President's Hall. Lucky ones may see us when we decide to drop in on classes in the halls around the quad.</p>
